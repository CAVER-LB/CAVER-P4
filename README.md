# CAVER-P4
CAVER: Enhancing RDMA Load Balancing by Hunting Less-Congested Paths

This repository incudes p4 programs of CAVER. We used `BF-SDE-9.4.0` to compile and run the program.

## 1.Topology Settings
We provide the details of the topology used in our source code, including switch ports and NIC IP configurations in picture `topo.pdf`. 
If you use a different topology, please update the `switch_config.h` file accordingly.

The `Caver_ToR` folder should be downloaded to the lower-layer switches, while the `Caver_Middle` folder should be downloaded to the upper-layer switches.

## 2.Build P4 and controller code



## 3.Run
